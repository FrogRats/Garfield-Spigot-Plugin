# The Lasagne (Garfield) Spigot Plugin
Ever wanted to make yourself a wonderful lasagne while playing minecraft? Well now you can!  
All you need to do is download our plugin and add it to your Spigot server's Plugins folder and you're all good to go.

## Inspiration
Over the summer break we got really invested in a particular minecraft build of ours and would continue to talk about making a mod together the following months. We saw HackNotts2020 as an oppotunity to work on the skills necessary to make minecraft mods ... and here we are now ...

## What it does
The plugin incorporates a new recipe into the game. A lasagne recipe to be precise, which users can make using the following crafting pattern:
Once created and consumed the lasagne seems to have an unfortunate curse tied to it ... #whoops 

## How we built it
We built it primarily using Spigot-API and Java. In addition to that we also needed to dabble a little in modifying .json files and metadata to get our assets integrated into the game via our plugin.

## Challenges we ran into
A big challenge we had was trying to get our assets to work with our plugin. There were a surpsing amount of hurdles but we managed to find a good solution to the issue within the 24 hours ... (though hopefully temporary as we continue to work on this project post-event). 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Everything! This plugin/mod is something we've talked about for ages and we're just so proud to see it finally come to life ... also the cursed energy it radiates is always a plus in the meme-department.

## What we learned
Modding is hard but definitely rewarding ... and now we've got Java to add to our tool belt too!

## What's next for the Project
We're hoping to refine the mod a little bit more over the Christmas break and then see where it leads us too ...

A wild garfield in its natural habitat ... definitely not a reskinned ravager ...
